**The tasks composed of multiple or one dataset; each dataset requires certain operations and has different modeling goals**

**Task 1 is not included as it is a researching task for Linear and Logistic Regression theory**
<h2>Task 2</h2>

implemented ___Linear regression___ model on the first dataset due to its target quantitive nature and did some data cleaning and preprocessing alongside with a ___Residual plot___ to determine if Linear Regression is suitable for the data or not.

implemented ___Logistic regression___ model on the second dataset due to its target binary nature (0, 1) and it aligns with business goal of finding churn and non churn customers.

<h2>Task 3</h2>

Explored the data with different visualizations and correlation heatmap along with distributions to find relationships between features and to see the correlation between the target feature and the other features.

Gathered some insights about Age groups in the bank, their credit scores and their subscription plans to determine churning rate among different age and gathered some interesting findings which are located inside the notebook.

Preprocessed the data by scaling, deleting outliers and encoding to ensure high quality of the training dataset.

Implemented ___Logistic Regression___ and ___Decision Tree___ algorithms and researched their accuracy using different metrics (F1-score, confusion matrix, Percision and Recall)

<h2>Task 4</h2>

Using the same dataset, I implemented ___ensemble tree___ algorithms like ___Random Forest___ and ___XGBoost___ and made a table that compare their effeciencies along with a ___feature importance___ graph to determing the feature contribution to model prediction
